You can start it even if you don't know how to create a dataframe or even a new directory to write files, tables and databases.\n\n## What does this template do?\n- Create 3 pySpark DataFrames for relational data transformation practice\n- Create 4 folders to write data ```[current user directory, raw, structured, curated]```\n- Create 1 databese in the strutured zone\n- You can see the source code and learn from it\n- Reset the Environment (has the functions to clean your environment)\n- How to create tables (in Hive database), see the 04-Table_Reference notebook.\n\n## Notebooks\n1. [Config-DataFrame]($./Includes/Config-DataFrame)\n1. [Config-Directories]($./Includes/Config-Directories)\n1. [Config-Database]($./Includes/Config-Database)\n1. [common]($./Includes/common)\n1. [Reset-Environment]($./Includes/Reset-Environment)\n1. [01-Training_Python]($./Training/01-Training_Python)\n1. [02-Table-Reference]($./02-Table-Reference)\n\n\n## How to use it?\n- Just import the data-engineering.dbc file in your [Databricks Community account ](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) and run the ```01-Training_Python``` notebook.\n\n\n\n## Feel free to contribute\n### ![gihub logo](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/iconsimple-logotypes/512/github-48.png) [data-engineering-with-databricks](https://github.com/ac-gomes/data-engineering-with-databricks)\n\n\n\n## Enjoy it!"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"ffb6b902-9ef9-45db-9eb0-9a2a60dc9335"}}}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"01-GetStarted","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":4},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":4321493112919599}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
